# Climate_Trend_Analyzer
Description
A Python-based program called ClimateTrends Analyzer is made to handle, examine, and display climate data from
different sources. With the help of this project, scholars, environmental scientists, and climate enthusiasts will
be able to examine historical trends in temperature, precipitation, and other climate-related variables using a
robust yet intuitive interface.
Key- features:
1. Data Import and Cleaning: The program can import climatic data in a variety of file formats (CSV, JSON, and
Excel) and perform preliminary data cleaning operations. It deals with the dataset's outliers, inconsistent values,
and missing values.

2. Statistical Analysis: To study climate data, ClimateTrends Analyzer provides a number of statistical tools, such
as:
Computing the mode, median, and mean for various climate variables
Linear regression trend analysis
Seasonal breakdown of time series information
Anomaly detection to find odd trends in the climate
3. Data Visualization: To aid users in better understanding climate trends, the project offers a number of
visualization choices.

- Line graphs showing the patterns in temperature and precipitation throughout time
- Heatmaps for illustrating seasonal trends
- Box plots that display how climate variables are distributed throughout various time periods
Interactive maps that show the geographic climate data

4.Climate Index Calculations:
The tool can calculate various climate indices such as:
Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)
Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)
Growing Degree Days (GDD)
